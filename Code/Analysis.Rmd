## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document.

```{r gapminder}
gapminder <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Harrisburg University/ANLY 506-90-O/Exploratory-Data-Analytics/Data/gapminder.csv")
summary(gapminder)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r income, echo=FALSE}
plot(hist(gapminder$life))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
